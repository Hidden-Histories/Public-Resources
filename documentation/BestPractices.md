# Best Practices for creating AR content

## Overview

In this document we suggest best practices to follow in both your workflow creating AR artworks, and in creating content for the artwork itself. 
- Remember: computers and smartphones are stupid, you have to think for them!
- One misplaced letter/number/space can make your artwork fail to work. Read the directions carefully!

## Workflow

Download Unity: 
(See [Tamiko's Creating porPOIse Asset Bundles in Unity]( https://github.com/Hidden-Histories/Public-Resources/blob/master/documentation/CreatingAssetBundles.md#-hidden-histories) or [Prof. Rhonda's "Introduction to Unity3D Editor" slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CzzGu4zK2a9VsXfM0WVPNGqtQfGEr30u67TTrWYI8qU/edit#slide=id.g7f6e1f9622_0_516)
- ALWAYS first install the **Unity Hub,** and download versions to it, not directly onto your computer.
- ONLY use Unity3D Editor version **2018.3.14** as asset bundle creation does not work in other versions. (Think of "pi": 2018.Ï€)
- ALWAYS open your project via Unity Hub, not by clicking on the Unity3d Editor icon itself. If we have to switch to another version soon, this allows you to check which version you are using to open the project. Using the wrong project can destroy it completely for ever. :-(



## Size of your assets/asset bundles

### How many MB is your asset bundle??? 
- Young people often balk at downloading the ARpoise app because its 40MB exceeds the storage space left on their phone.
- If they are doing a Hidden Histories tour, they have to download the asset bundles for each and every layer as well. 
- How big are the images, models, video, sound files that make up each prefab?

### Images:
- Keep your original files **outside of your Unity folder** because anything you delete in Unity is gone forever. :-(
- **Keep your original files at their original resolution,** and make lower resolution versions to use in Unity.
- Use **jpgs** if you need the entire image.
- Use **pngs** ONLY if you have transparency or cutouts! A cutout of your Aunt Mitsuko can look great standing in front of her store! :-)
- The **maximum size Unity will allow is 2048 x 2048 pixels**
  - Remember that your user's smartphone screen might not be that big anyway!
  - Try 1024 x 1024 pixels and see if that looks fine.
