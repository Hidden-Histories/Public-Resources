# Tutorial: Remote Site Visit

If you are creating an AR layer that is to be viewed at a very specific site, it is important to understand the physical site itself. Even if you think you know and understand the site, **collect images** and look at the **satellite images of the site on google maps** to get some real information on it.

NOTE: I will use the JACL in the Issei Building in San Jose Japantown as an example. I am doing this on my Windows PC, and the commands and behavior of the websites might be different depending on what you are using.

- Go to [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) in your browser and search for your site.
- Note the **scale bar** - we will need this!
- Click on the **satellite** inset to switch to satellite view.
