Installing Unity

Can this be done via remote desktop for artists who can't do it themselves? Or should they just assume for now that a helper will do all the Unity work for them?

NOTE: Unity was developed for creating computer games, so most tutorials are much more complicated than what you will need for creating augments for ARpoise. You do NOT need to learn scripting to create AR with ARpoise. Additionaly, complicated lighting will not work in AR.

    Select "Download Unity Hub" from this page: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download
    Then download Unity version 2018.3.14 from this page (other versions might not work!):
    https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive
        Select the tab Unity 2018.x
        Scroll down to 2018.3.14 (26 Apr. 2019) and click "Unity Hub"

Using the Unity Editor:

AssetBundles

    Unity templates
        geolocative
        image trigger
        iOS
        Android
        can assetsbundles be created on either Mac or Windows?

We are providing a Unity template that can be used
