## Using the ARpoise Augmented Reality App

. 
### Download and install the ARpoise AR app

- Download the ARpoise AR app from the http://arpoise.com/, which has links to both iOS and Android stores. (Notice the links to the brief list of ARpiose projects on that page - we will use them to learn how to use the ARpoise app.)

- Install the app, and accept all permissions. 

- You might need to go into your Settings / Privacy / and allow ARpoise to use your location data.

### Viewing augments

Start the app ...

**If there are layers located near you**

- If there is only one layer located near you, you will immediately see it appear in your smartphone display. 

- Look around, up and down - there may be augments all around you, as well as above and below.

**If there two or more layers located near you**

- If there are two or more layers located near you, you will see a list of available layers. 

- Select one of them, and look around you.


**Default layer: If there are no layers located near you**

- If there are NO layers near you, ARpoise will immediately start the default ARpoise layer. 

- Right now, (March 2020), this is [Evolution of Fish](http://www.tamikothiel.com/evolutionoffish/), by Tamiko Thiel and /p. 

- It turns your surroundings into an underwater reef, filled with schools of fish. If you move your smartphone around, the fish will follow your lead - but the more you intervene in their virtual ecosystem, the more the fish will turn to plastic garbage. Give them a rest, hold the smartphone very still or it lay down, and they will slowly turn back into fish.

### Remote Viewing: ARpoise’s Fixed Position feature

If there are no AR layers in your immediate vicinity, you can use the **Fixed Position** feature of the ARpoise app to view augment layers that are elsewhere.

Tamiko Thiel’s and Midori Kono Thiel’s “Brush the Sky” calligraphic AR artworks are located in Japantown, San Jose, California. You can download a pdf of an [AR tour of the artworks](http://tamikothiel.com/brushthesky/PR/BrushTheSky_AR-tourSanJoseJapantown.pdf).

If you do not live near to the artwork locations in San Jose Japantown, they will not show up in the ARpoise app list of layers near you. If you cannot physically go there, you can still use ARpoise’s Fixed Location feature to view augments remotely. It will overlay the augments over your own immediate environment, which is not the same experience as seeing them at the “real” sites in Japantown. But it is a handy feature that you can also use to test out changes to your artworks even if they are positioned somewhere in the world far away from you.

To view the Brush the Sky augments at your own home:

Look at the Brush the Sky AR tour pdf for the addresses of the different AR layers.


Find one of the locations in Google Maps. 


Then for the best experience, find out the decimal coordinates for the GPS latitude and longitude of where you would stand if you were at that location, i.e. perhaps not in the building, but standing in front of it!

Start the ARpoise app.


Double click on the ARpoise logo menu button.


Tap the Lat and Lon fields and enter the decimal values you found in Google Maps.


Click Activate Fixed Position.


Click OK.

 
The layers should then appear in your list of nearby augment layers.
Select one of the layers ...

 
. ... and you should see the augments layered over your own surroundings! Look all around you -  they are also above and below you!
