## Using the ARpoise Augmented Reality App ![ARpoise Logo](images/ARpoise_logo_rgb_64.png)

This tutorial shows you how to use the ARpoise Augmented Reality App to view geolocative augmented reality, computer graphic artworks positioned at specific physical locations via their GPS coordinates. ARpoise should work on most iOS and Android smartphones. (At this time ARpoise has a sister app, [AR-vos](UsingAR-vosApp.md#-ar-vos-augmented-reality-app), that can view geolocative, image trigger and SLAM AR, but only on newer, higher end smartphones.)

. 
### Download and install the ARpoise AR app

- Download the ARpoise AR app from the http://arpoise.com/, which links to both iOS and Android stores.

- Install the app, and **accept all permissions!**

- You might need to go into your Settings/Privacy settings  and allow ARpoise to use your location data.

### Troubleshooting: Force closing the app
If the app ever does not work as it should, try force closing and restarting it.

  - How to [force close Android apps](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/close-android-apps,news-21281.html).
  - If you have successfully force closed the app, when you start it again the Unity start screen appears:

## Viewing augments depends on where you are physically located:

Start the app ...

**If there are layers located near you** 

(NOTE: During the coronavirus lockdown we have located your two layers at your house, so at home you should see a list with both your ExampleLayer and your ArtistLayer.)

- If there is only one layer located near you, it will **automatically appear in your smartphone display.**

- If there are two or more layers located near you:
  - you will see a **list of available layers.**
  - Select one of them, and look around you. 
  - To select another one, tap the ARpoise icon menu **once** to get the list again.

**Default layer: If there are NO layers located near you**

(NOTE: If you want to see these layers, you need to go somewhere where there are no layers positioned, at least 2 long blocks away from your home. Don't go to Japantown, because then you'll see the Brush the Sky layers! Or do remote viewing as described in the next section, and go to the GPS poisition 2,2, or 10,10, etc.)

- If there are NO layers near you, ARpoise will automatically start the **default ARpoise layers list.** Right now, (April 2020), these are the following AR layers. Click on the links to read what each one is about, and how to interact with it. To select a different one, tap the ARpoise icon menu once to get the list again.

## Exercise1: Remote Viewing with ARpoise’s Fixed Position feature

If you want to look at AR layers that are far away from your current position, you can use the **Fixed Position** feature of the ARpoise app to view them. This is also very useful for testing changes you make to your own layers, even if their final location is far away from your home.

To practice this quickly, we have set a couple of AR layers at the GPS position Latitude 1, Longitude 1 (which is in the Gulf of Guinea, West Africa!)

### Enter the GPS coodinates 1, 1 in the Fixed Position menu:

- Start the ARpoise app.
- **Double click** on the **ARpoise logo menu button** ![ARpoise logo](images/ARpoise_logo_rgb_64.png) in the top left corner to get the Fixed Position menu:
- Tap the **Lat** field, enter 1, then click OK, Done etc. to save.
- Tap the **Lon** field, enter 1, then click OK, Done etc. to save.
- Check **Activate Fixed Position.**
- Click **OK.**

![Arpoise Fixed Position Lat 1 Lon 1](images/Arpoise_FixedPosition1-1_white.png)

. 

You should get a list of the layers that we put at this position.
- If you **don't** get this list, please follow the [troubleshooting instructions above](UsingARpoiseApp.md#troubleshooting-force-closing-the-app) to force close the app and restart it!

![Arpoise Fixed Position Lat 1 Lon 1](images/Arpoise_FixedPositionLayerList_white.png)

- Select one of the layers and it should appear - look all around you!

![Arpoise Fixed Position Lat 1 Lon 1](images/Arpoise_FixedPositionReignOfGold_white.png)

- **But remember to turn off Fixed Position after viewing!** Otherwise, no matter where you are standing, your smartphone will think you are always at the same location!

## Exercise2: Remote Viewing of Brush the Sky in San Jose Japantown

As a more useful example, we will show you how to view Tamiko Thiel’s and Midori Kono Thiel’s **Brush the Sky** calligraphic AR artworks, which are located in San Jose Japantown. You can use the same technique to view your own AR artworks once you have moved them to Japantown.

- **Download** the [AR tour of the artworks](http://tamikothiel.com/brushthesky/PR/BrushTheSky_AR-tourSanJoseJapantown.pdf), so you can see where the various augments are located in Japantown.

### Viewing Brush the Sky augments at home: first get GPS coordinates

- Find an artwork you wish to view in the [AR tour of the artworks](http://tamikothiel.com/brushthesky/PR/BrushTheSky_AR-tourSanJoseJapantown.pdf).

- Search for the address of that location in [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/).

- Then get the decimal coordinates for that GPS latitude and longitude - [see instructions how to get the GPS coordinates here.](https://www.businessinsider.de/international/how-to-find-coordinates-on-google-maps/).

### Enter the GPS coodinates in the Fixed Position menu:

- Start the ARpoise app.

- **Double click** on the **ARpoise logo menu button.**

![Arpoise Fixed Position Wesley United](images/Arpoise_FixedPositionWesleyUnited_800w.png)


- Tap the **Lat** and the **Lon** fields, enter the decimal values you found in Google Maps, then click OK or the check mark to save.

- Click **Activate Fixed Position.**

- Click **OK.**

### This layer should appear in the available layers list - with other nearby layers too

The layers should then appear in your list of nearby augment layers, even though you are not really standing there. Since GPS is only accurate to about +/- 20 meters, you will see other layers that are nearby as well.

![Arpoise_ARpoiseLayersList_800w](images/Arpoise_ARpoiseLayersList_800w.png)

- Select one of the layers ...

... and you should see the augments layered over your own surroundings!

![Arpoise_ARpoiseLayersList_800w](images/Arpoise_FixedPosition_KizunaWesleyUnited_900w.png)


- To see a different layer, click the **ARpoise logo menu button** ONCE and you will get the layer list again. Select another one and it should appear around you.

- **REMEMBER to uncheck Activate Fixed Position** when you are done, otherwise you will not see any local augments, for instance if you create ones yourself in your own home!
