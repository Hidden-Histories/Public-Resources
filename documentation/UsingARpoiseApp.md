## Using the ARpoise Augmented Reality App

(Quick link: we have installed a number of [ARpoise artworks](https://github.com/ARPOISE/ARpoise#arpoise-examples) at the GPS location Lat = 1, Lon = 1 in the Atlantic Ocean (actually on the Equator in the Gulf of Guinea) for your viewing pleasure. If you don't know how to use fixed position for remote viewing of augments, read **Remote Viewing: ARpoise’s Fixed Position feature** below.)
. 
### Download and install the ARpoise AR app

- Download the ARpoise AR app from the http://arpoise.com/, which has links to both iOS and Android stores. (Notice the links to the brief list of ARpiose projects on that page - we will use them to learn how to use the ARpoise app.)

- Install the app, and **accept all permissions!**

- You might need to go into your Settings/Privacy settings  and allow ARpoise to use your location data.

. 
### Viewing augments

Start the app ...

**If there are layers located near you**

- If there is only one layer located near you, it will **automatically appear in your smartphone display.**

- Look around, up and down - there may be augments all around you, as well as above and below.

**If there two or more layers located near you**

- If there are two or more layers located near you, you will see a **list of available layers.**

- Select one of them, and look around you.

**Default layer: If there are NO layers located near you**

- If there are NO layers near you, ARpoise will automatically start the **default ARpoise layer.** 

- Right now, (March 2020), this is [Evolution of Fish](http://www.tamikothiel.com/evolutionoffish/), by Tamiko Thiel and /p. 

- It turns your surroundings into an underwater reef, filled with schools of fish. If you move your smartphone around, the fish will follow your lead - but the more you intervene in their virtual ecosystem, the more the fish will turn to plastic garbage. Give them a rest, hold the smartphone very still or it lay down, and they will slowly turn back into fish.

### Remote Viewing: ARpoise’s Fixed Position feature

If there are no AR layers in your immediate vicinity, you can use the **Fixed Position** feature of the ARpoise app to view augment layers that are elsewhere.

Tamiko Thiel’s and Midori Kono Thiel’s **Brush the Sky** calligraphic AR artworks are located in Japantown, San Jose, California. You can download a pdf of an [AR tour of the artworks](http://tamikothiel.com/brushthesky/PR/BrushTheSky_AR-tourSanJoseJapantown.pdf).

If you do not live near to the artwork locations in San Jose Japantown, and cannot physically go there, you can still use ARpoise’s Fixed Location feature to view augments remotely. It will make ARpoise think that you are stannding at that remote location, and you will see the augments overlaying your own immediate environment. This is of course not the same experience as seeing them at the “real” sites in Japantown, but it is a handy feature that you can also use to test out changes to your own artworks even if they are positioned somewhere in the world far away from you.

#### Viewing Brush the Sky augments at home: first get GPS coordinates

- Find an artwork you wish to view in the [AR tour of the artworks](http://tamikothiel.com/brushthesky/PR/BrushTheSky_AR-tourSanJoseJapantown.pdf).

- Search for the address of that location in [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/).

- Then get the decimal coordinates for that [GPS latitude and longitude](https://www.businessinsider.de/international/how-to-find-coordinates-on-google-maps/).

#### Enter the GPS coodinates in the Fixed Position menu:

- Start the ARpoise app.

- **Double click** on the **ARpoise logo menu button.**

- Tap the **Lat and Lon fields** and enter the decimal values you found in Google Maps.

- Click **Activate Fixed Position.**

- Click **OK.**

#### This layer should appear in the available layers list - with other nearby layers too

The layers should then appear in your list of nearby augment layers, even though you are not really standing there. Since GPS is only accurate to about +/1 20 meters, you will see other layers that are nearby as well.

![Arpoise_ARpoiseLayersList_800w](images/Arpoise_ARpoiseLayersList_800w.png)

- Select one of the layers ...

- ... and you should see the augments layered over your own surroundings!

- To see a different layer, click the **ARpoise logo menu button** ONCE and you will get the layer list again. Select another one.

**REMEMBER to uncheck Activate Fixed Position** when you are done, otherwise you will not see any local augments, for instance if you create ones yourself in your own home!
