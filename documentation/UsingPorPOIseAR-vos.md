# ARpoise PorPOISe - create AR-vos image trigger and SLAM layers

## Overview

If you haven't used the AR-vos app recently to try out image trigger and SLAM AR, take a look at the tutorial [Using the AR-vos App to view image trigger and SLAM based AR artworks][https://github.com/Hidden-Histories/Public-Resources/blob/master/documentation/UsingAR-vosApp.md#-hidden-histories] to refresh your memory.

You create geolocative AR content for AR-vos app in exactly the same way you do for the ARpoise app, and this tutorial assumes you already know how to do that. If you need to practice, please see the tutorial [Using porPOIse: Set up and modify ARpoise app layers](https://github.com/Hidden-Histories/Public-Resources/blob/master/documentation/UsingPorPOIse.md#-hidden-histories).
