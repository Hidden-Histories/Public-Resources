# ARpoise PorPOISe - create AR-vos image trigger and SLAM layers

## Overview

As we mentioned in the tutorial [Using the AR-vos App to view image trigger and SLAM based AR artworks](https://github.com/Hidden-Histories/Public-Resources/blob/master/documentation/UsingAR-vosApp.md#-hidden-histories), AR-vos is a more advanced AR app that can do not only geolocative AR, but also image trigger and SLAM AR. If you haven't played around recently with the example image trigger and SLAM layers in AR-vos, take a look at that tutorial to refresh your memory.

You create geolocative AR content for the AR-vos app in exactly the same way you do for the ARpoise app. If you need to practice, please see the tutorial [Using porPOIse: Set up and modify ARpoise app layers](https://github.com/Hidden-Histories/Public-Resources/blob/master/documentation/UsingPorPOIse.md#-hidden-histories).
